Ingredients

    4 cups baby spinach
    2 cups cilantro leaves with tender stems
    1 Tbsp. white miso
    1 garlic clove
    ½ cup grapeseed or sunflower oil
    1 tsp. toasted sesame oil
    1 tsp. fresh lemon juice
    Kosher salt
    2 5-oz. packages fresh ramen noodles (you can find them fresh at Asian grocery stores and some Whole Foods—we like the Sun Noodle brand)
    1 Tbsp. unsalted butter, cut into small pieces
    Toasted sesame seeds (for serving)

Steps
    Bring a medium pot of water to a boil.

    Meanwhile, purée spinach, cilantro, miso, garlic, grapeseed oil, sesame oil, and lemon juice in a blender until mixture is smooth and very green. Season with salt and pour pesto into a medium bowl.

    Cook noodles according to package directions. Drain and add to bowl with pesto. Add butter and toss until butter is melted and noodles are coated in sauce.

    Divide noodles between bowls and top with sesame seeds.
